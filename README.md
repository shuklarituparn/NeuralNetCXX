<H2>How to run: </H1>

- First make the training set using the following command:
  
    ```bash
     make TrainingData
    ```
  The TrainingData will be collected into `TrainingData.txt` in the `lib` folder
  
  
- Now run the neural net using the following command:
  ```bash
  make NeuralNet
    ```
  
The output of the neural network is given in the file `output.txt` in the `lib` folder
